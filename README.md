Working as of 6:01am 17/05/2025, wouldn't try to merge it with main just yet, I don't think I have revision control set up properly on my end.
Safest bet is to download the zip from the repo, extract it somewhere and then just open the project. Perhaps one of you can see the new landscape material and implement it into main, as well as the rock and grass material.
The landscape just uses the M_LandscacpeRVT and not the material instance, since it was easier to debug that way, so create a new instance.
